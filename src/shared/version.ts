/**
 * The version of the build that is actually loaded.
 *
 * A card rendered by a stale runtime looks exactly like a card rendered by the
 * code you are reading, and the difference is invisible until someone argues
 * about it. Putting the version in the header turns "is this the new build?" into
 * a one-glance question.
 *
 * Cross-platform by construction: the path comes from `import.meta.url`, so it
 * resolves identically on Windows (`C:\…`) and POSIX, and no shell, environment
 * variable or `path.join` is involved. A missing or unreadable manifest degrades
 * to `unknown` rather than breaking card rendering.
